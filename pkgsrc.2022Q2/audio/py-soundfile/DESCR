SoundFile is an audio library based on libsndfile, CFFI and NumPy.

SoundFile can read and write sound files. File reading/writing is
supported through libsndfile, which is a free, cross-platform,
open-source (LGPL) library for reading and writing many different
sampled sound file formats that runs on many platforms. SoundFile
represents audio data as NumPy arrays.
