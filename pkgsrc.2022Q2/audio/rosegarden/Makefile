# This package is the (now really old) X11 version of Rosegarden, which
# upstream now barely admits ever existed and had its own version number
# sequence. The following *is* the project home page. Note: if anyone
# gets around to importing a modern Rosegarden, it's probably a good idea
# to keep a copy of this package as rosegarden-x11.
