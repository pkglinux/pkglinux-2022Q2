Davis is a MDP client for music lovers.
Davis displays any metadata you like! The performers, conductor, ensemble,
work, movement, recording location, etc., can all be displayed so long as it's
in your tags.

It can fetch album art directly from MPD, using the albumart command of
the MPD protocol. This means that davis can fetch album art even from remote
MPD instances, and does not need to know the location of your music directory.
With a custom subcommand, it is also possible to display the album art as sixel
graphics in the terminal.

Davis can be extended with custom subcommands, see upstream repository.
