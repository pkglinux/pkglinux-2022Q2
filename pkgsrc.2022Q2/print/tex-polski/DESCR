Tools to typeset monolingual Polish documents in LaTeX2e
without babel or polyglossia. The package loads Polish
hyphenation patterns, ensures that a font encoding suitable for
Polish is used; in particular it enables Polish adaptation of
Computer Modern fonts (the so-called PL fonts), provides
translations of \today and names like "Bibliography" or
"Chapter", redefines math symbols according to Polish
typographical tradition, provides macros for dashes according
to Polish orthography, provides a historical input method for
"Polish characters", works with traditional TeX as well as with
Unicode aware variants. (This package was previously known as
platex, but has been renamed to resolve a name clash.)
