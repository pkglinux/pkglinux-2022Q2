The memoir class is for typesetting poetry, fiction,
non-fiction, and mathematical works. Permissible document
'base' font sizes range from 9 to 60pt. There is a range of
page-styles and well over a dozen chapter-styles to choose
from, as well as methods for specifying your own layouts and
designs. The class also provides the functionality of over
thirty of the more popular packages, thus simplifying document
sources. Users who wish to use the hyperref package, in a
document written with the memoir class, should also use the
memhfixc package (part of this bundle). Note, however, that any
current version of hyperref actually loads the package
automatically if it detects that it is running under memoir.
