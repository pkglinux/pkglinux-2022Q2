ZXing-C++ ("zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D
barcode image processing library implemented in C++.

It was originally ported from the Java ZXing Library but has been
developed further and now includes many improvements in terms of
quality and performance. It can both read and write barcodes in a
number of formats.
