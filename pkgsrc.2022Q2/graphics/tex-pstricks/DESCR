PSTricks offers an extensive collection of macros for
generating PostScript that is usable with most TeX macro
formats, including Plain TeX, LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and AMS-LaTeX.
Included are macros for colour, graphics, pie charts, rotation,
trees and overlays. It has many special features, including a
wide variety of graphics (picture drawing) macros, with a
flexible interface and with colour support. There are macros
for colouring or shading the cells of tables. The package
pstricks-add contains bug-fixes and additions for PSTricks
(among other things). PSTricks ordinarily uses PostScript
\special commands, which are not supported by pdf(La)TeX. This
limitation may be overcome by using either the pst-pdf or the
pdftricks package, to generate a PDF inclusion from a PSTricks
diagram. PSTricks macros can also generate PDF output when the
document is processed XeTeX, without the need for other
supporting packages.
