This font was originally released as Deutschmeister in 1927 at the
type foundry Ludwig Wagner. FDI Altmeister is a carefully crafted
revival released for free under the Open Font License. This was
made possible by the generous support of people around the world,
who pledged for this project on Kickstarter.

FDI Altmeister has around 400 glyphs covering Western, Eastern and
Central European Latin. Many characters have alternative glyphs,
so both traditional German blackletter typesetting and international
use with improved legibility are possible.
