This font was originally released during the 1930s as part of the
Deutschmeister font family at the type foundry Ludwig Wagner. FDI
Neumeister is a carefully crafted revival released for free under
the Open Font License. This was made possible by the generous
support of people around the world, who pledged for this project
on Kickstarter.

FDI Neumeister has around 400 glyphs covering Western, Eastern and
Central European Latin. Many characters have alternative glyphs,
so both traditional German blackletter typesetting and international
use with improved legibility are possible.
