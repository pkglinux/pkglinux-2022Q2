The shell program /bin/bash (hereafter referred to as “the shell”) uses a collection of startup files to help create the environment to run in. Each file has a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments differently. The files in the /etc directory provide global settings. If equivalent files exist in the home directory, they may override the global settings.

An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using /bin/login, by reading the /etc/passwd file. An interactive non-login shell is started at the command-line (e.g., [prompt]$/bin/bash). A non-interactive shell is usually present when a shell script is running. It is non-interactive because it is processing a script and not waiting for user input between commands.

For more information, see the Bash Startup Files and Interactive Shells sections in the Bash Features chapter of the Bash info pages (info bash).

The files /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile are read when the shell is invoked as an interactive login shell.
