  in BusyBox often have fewer options than their full-featured cousins;
  however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality
  and behave very much like their larger counterparts.

  BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in
  mind, both to produce small binaries and to reduce run-time memory usage.
  Busybox is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude
  commands (or features) at compile time.  This makes it easy to customize
  embedded systems; to create a working system, just add /dev, /etc, and a
