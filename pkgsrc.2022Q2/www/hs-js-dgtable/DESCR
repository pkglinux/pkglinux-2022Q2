This package bundles the minified jquery.dgtable code into a Haskell
package, so it can be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first three
components of the version number match the upstream jquery.dgtable
version. The package is designed to meet the redistribution requirements of
downstream users (e.g. Debian).
