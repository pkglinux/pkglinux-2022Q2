Retrie is a tool for codemodding Haskell. Key goals include:

* Speed: Efficiently rewrite in large (>1 million line) codebases.
* Safety: Avoids large classes of codemod-related errors.
* Ease-of-use: Haskell syntax instead of regular expressions. No
  hand-rolled AST traversals.

This package provides a command-line tool (retrie) and a library (Retrie)
for making equational edits to Haskell code.
