Confuse is a configuration library for Python that uses YAML. It takes
care of defaults, overrides, type checking, command-line integration,
human-readable errors, and standard OS-specific locations.

Here's what Confuse brings to the table:

-  An utterly sensible API resembling dictionary-and-list structures
   but providing transparent validation without lots of boilerplate
   code.
-  Combine configuration data from multiple sources. Using
   layering, Confuse allows user-specific configuration to seamlessly
   override system-wide configuration, which in turn overrides built-in
   defaults.
-  Look for configuration files in platform-specific paths.
-  Integration with command-line arguments via argparse or optparse
   from the standard library.
