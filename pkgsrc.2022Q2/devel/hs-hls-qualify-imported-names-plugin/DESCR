You've imported a number of modules, and have written a lot of code with
unqualified names. You want to import a new module but you know there will
be a number name clashes so you want to switch your current usage of names
to be qualified. It would be nice if you could change

  import Blah

to

  import Blah as Bloo

then magically qualify all the previous names imported from Blah with
Bloo. After doing that you could then change

  import Blah as Bloo

to

  import qualified Blah as Bloo

and import your the new module using names from it without worry. Well, now
you can...
