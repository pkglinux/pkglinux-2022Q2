libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and
decompression.

The supported formats are:

- DEFLATE (raw)
- zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
- gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)

libdeflate is heavily optimized.  It is significantly faster than the zlib
library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
processors.  In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".

libdeflate itself is a library, but the following command-line programs which
use this library are also provided:

* gzip (or gunzip), a program which mostly behaves like the standard equivalent,
  except that it does not yet have good streaming support and therefore does not
  yet support very large files
* benchmark, a program for benchmarking in-memory compression and decompression
