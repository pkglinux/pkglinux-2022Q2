The call hierarchy plugin can review the code to determine where functions
are called and how they relate to other functions.

This plugin is useful when debugging and refactoring code because it allows
you to see how different parts of the code are related. And it is more
conducive for users to quickly understand their macro architecture in the
face of strange code.
