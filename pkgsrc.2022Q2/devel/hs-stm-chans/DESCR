This package offers a collection of channel types, similar to
Control.Concurrent.STM.{TChan,TQueue} but with additional features. In
particular we offer the following data types:

Control.Concurrent.STM.TBChan:
    Bounded FIFO channels. When the channel is full, writers will
    block/retry. This ensures that the writers do not get too far ahead of
    the readers, which helps to make sure that memory and cpu resources are
    used responsibly.

Control.Concurrent.STM.TMChan:
    Closeable FIFO channels.

Control.Concurrent.STM.TMQueue:
    Closeable FIFO queues. Like TChan (Maybe a) but with a monotonicity
    guarantee that once Nothing is returned all future reads will be
    Nothing as well.

Control.Concurrent.STM.TBMChan:
    Bounded Closeable FIFO channels.

Control.Concurrent.STM.TBMQueue:
    Bounded Closeable FIFO queues. Combines the capabilities of TBChan and
    TMChan.
