This package provides additional safety and simplicity versus
Control.Exception by having its functions recognize the difference between
synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. As described below, synchronous
exceptions are treated as recoverable, allowing you to catch and handle
them as well as clean up after them, whereas asynchronous exceptions can
only be cleaned up after. In particular, this library prevents you from
making the following mistakes:

* Catching and swallowing an asynchronous exception
* Throwing an asynchronous exception synchronously
* Throwing a synchronous exception asynchronously
* Swallowing asynchronous exceptions via failing cleanup handlers
