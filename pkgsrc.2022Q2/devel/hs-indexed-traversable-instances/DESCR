This package provides extra instances for type-classes in the
indexed-traversable package.

The intention is to keep this package minimal; it provides instances that
formely existed in lens or optics-extra. We recommend putting other
instances directly into their defining packages. The indexed-traversable
package is light, having only GHC boot libraries as its dependencies.
