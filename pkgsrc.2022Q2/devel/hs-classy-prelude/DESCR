A better Prelude. Haskell's Prelude needs to maintain backwards
compatibility and has many aspects that no longer represents best
practice. The goals of classy-prelude are:

* remove all partial functions
* modernize data structures
  * generally use Text instead of String
  * encourage the use of appropriate data structures such as Vectors or
    HashMaps instead of always using lists and associated lists
* reduce import lists and the need for qualified imports

classy-prelude should only be used by application developers. Library
authors should consider using mono-traversable, which classy-prelude builds
upon.
