SDDM is a modern display manager for X11 and Wayland aiming to be fast,
simple and beautiful. It uses modern technologies like QtQuick, which in
turn gives the designer the ability to create smooth, animated user interfaces.

SDDM is extremely themeable. We put no restrictions on the user interface
design, it is completely up to the designer. We simply provide a few callbacks
to the user interface which can be used for authentication, suspend etc.
