Devil's Pie
===========

Copyright (C) 2002-5, Ross Burton <ross@burtonini.com>


A window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfish's "Matched Windows" option and
the lack such functionality in Metacity. Metacity lacking window matching is not
a bad thing -- Metacity is a lean window manager, and window manipulation does
not have to be a window manager task.

Devil's Pie can be configured to detect windows as they are created, and match
the window to a set of rules. If the window matches the rules, it can perform a
series of actions on that window. For example, I can make X-Chat appear on all
workspaces, and make a particular xterm not appear in the pager or task list.
