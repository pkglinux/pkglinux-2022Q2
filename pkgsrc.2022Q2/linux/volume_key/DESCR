=====
The volume_key project provides a libvolume_key, a library for manipulating
storage volume encryption keys and storing them separately from volumes, and an
associated command-line tool, named volume_key.

The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted
hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key
back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software
failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the
company data after an employee leaves abruptly.

In a corporate setting the IT help desk could use it to back up the encryption
keys before handing the computer over to the end user.  volume_key can be used
by individual users as well.

volume_key currently supports only the LUKS volume encryption format.  Support
for other formats is possible, some formats are planned for future releases.
