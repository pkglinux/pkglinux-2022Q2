GNU Parted
----------

GNU Parted is a program for manipulating partition tables.

WARNING: USING PARTED TO PERFORM FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parted (post-2.4) no longer has the ability to create and modify file systems.
Use file-system-specific tools to create and operate on file systems.
For example, use the e2fsprogs programs to operate on ext2, ext3 and ext4
file systems.  Use programs from the reiserfsprogs package if you want to
manipulate reiserfs file systems.  Although Parted lets you do some of the
same things, the file-system-related code in parted is not as robust as the
code in more specialized, FS-specific packages.

Most FS-related functionality was removed after Parted 2.4.
Thus, the following commands are no longer supported:
mkpartfs, mkfs, cp, move, check, resize.
