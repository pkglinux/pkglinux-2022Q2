Monitors devices and executes rules for each insert or removal. Creates an
index of paths in /var/run/udev/ that libudev uses at runtime. Need to
trigger it once for weston to find a seat, that is a video card, keyboard
and mouse combo. Run `udevd -d` and `udevadm trigger`.

You can then backup the above dir and delete the package if your embedded
device set never changes. Somebody should code a libudev API clone finding
the seat using sysfs and watching /dev, which would eliminate the daemon
on desktops and ease porting wayland to BSD counterparts.
