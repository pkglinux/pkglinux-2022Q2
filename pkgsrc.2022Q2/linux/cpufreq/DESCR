The cpufrequtils package (homepage: 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/cpufreq/cpufrequtils.html ) 
consists of the following elements:


libcpufreq
----------

"libcpufreq" is a library which offers a unified access method for userspace
tools and programs to the cpufreq core and drivers in the Linux kernel. This
allows for code reduction in userspace tools, a clean implementation of
the interaction to the cpufreq core, and support for both the sysfs and proc
interfaces [depending on configuration, see below].


utils
-----

"cpufreq-info" determines current cpufreq settings, and provides useful
debug information to users and bug-hunters.
