mcwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System written from
scratch in C directly on top of XCB. It is a traditional floating window
manager with a lot of features but without the bloat.

In mcwm all functions, including move and resize, are available from the
keyboard but a pointing device can be used for move, resize and raise/lower.
