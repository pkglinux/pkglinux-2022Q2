X windows manipulator.

Windows are manipulated using the mouse, and can be moved/resized in
multiple ways. This utility is better used in combination with others like
[wmutils][0] and [sxhkd][1] which leverage the keyboard interface,
rather than mouse usage.

Features
- Floating window management
- Sloppy Focus
- All manipulations done with the mouse
- Cool operations like teleport, inflate/deflate
- 100% compatible with wmutils(1)
- Optional EWMH support through ewmh(1)
- Multi-monitor support through Xrandr(3)
