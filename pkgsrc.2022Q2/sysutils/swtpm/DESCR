The SWTPM package provides TPM emulators with different front-end interfaces
to libtpms. TPM emulators provide socket interfaces (TCP/IP and Unix) and
the Linux CUSE interface for the creation of multiple native /dev/vtpm* devices.

The SWTPM package also provides several tools for using the TPM emulator,
creating certificates for a TPM, and simulating the manufacturing of
a TPM by creating a TPM's EK and platform certificates etc.
