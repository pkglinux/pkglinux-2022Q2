Libtpms is a library that targets the integration of TPM functionality

It is assumed that the user of libtpms is familiar with the concepts
of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). For the interaction with libtpms
it is necessary to know how to construct valid TPM commands and to
be able to parse their results. It is not within the scope of libtpms's
documentation to provide background on this
