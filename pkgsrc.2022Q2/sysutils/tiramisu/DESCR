Desktop notifications, the UNIX way.
tiramisu is a notification daemon based on dunst that outputs notifications
to STDOUT in order to allow the user to process notifications any way they
prefer.

By allowing users to determine what is done with notifications, there is
infinitely more possibilities presented to the end-user than a simple
notification daemon that displays a block of text on the screen and nothing
more.

Users could have notifications display in a pre-existing bar, make a control
panel of some sort that shows notifications, push notifications to their phone
if their computer has been idle for an amount of time, make notifications more
accessible with text-to-speech, and so much more.
