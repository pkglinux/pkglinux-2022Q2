A modal editor inspired by kakoune.
Its main features include:
Multiple selections by default, based on Kakoune.
The whole design is based around multiple selections as an editing
primitive, with a single cursor just being a subset of that. Commands
manipulate selections which then allow you to concurrently edit code.
Editing is focused on being easy to reason with.

Syntax highlighting and code editing using Tree-sitter.
No more slow regex highlighting! Tree-sitter parses code into syntax
trees much like a compiler, giving us a lot more information about
code structure. We can track local variables, calculate indentation
and manipulate selection to select syntax nodes.
Parsing is incremental and fast enough to run on every keystroke.
Robust enough to produce results even with syntax errors.

- Built-in language server support.
  Context aware completion
  Documentation
  Diagnostics
  Code actions

- Runs in a terminal.
The base implementation uses a terminal frontend and combines well
with tmux or usage over ssh.
