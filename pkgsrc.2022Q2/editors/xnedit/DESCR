XNEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for the X Window System, which
combines a standard, easy to use, graphical user interface with the
thorough functionality and stability required by users who edit text
eight hours a day. It provides intensive support for development in
a wide variety of languages, text processors, and other tools, but at
the same time can be used productively by just about anyone who needs
to edit text.

XNEdit is a fork of the Nirvana Editor (NEdit) and provides new
functionality like antialiased text rendering and support for unicode.
