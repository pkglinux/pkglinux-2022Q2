Alacritty is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and
performance. With such a strong focus on performance, included
features are carefully considered and you can always expect Alacritty
to be blazingly fast (on modern hardware). By making good choices for
defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup. However, it does
allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.
