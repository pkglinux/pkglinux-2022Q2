PyQt-builder is a tool for generating Python bindings for C++ libraries that
use the Qt application framework. The bindings are built on top of the PyQt
bindings for Qt. PyQt-builder is used to build PyQt itself.

PyQt-builder is actually an extension of the PEP 384-compliant SIP bindings
generator and build system. In the simplest cases all that is needed is a
pyproject.toml file that specifies how the bindings are to be generated. More
complicated cases require additional code, typically implemented in a
project.py file.

PyQt-builder doesn't provide any additional command line build tools but does
extend the SIP tools by providing additional command line options and options
that can be specified in the pyproject.toml file. These are implemented by the
pyqtbuild module which also provides an API that can be used by a project's
project.py file.
