tuifeed is a news feed reader with a fancy terminal user interface.
It allows you read news from your favourite RSS and Atom sources, which can be
easily configured in a TOML file.

In order to start using tuifeed, the first thing you need to do is to configure
the feeds you want to read from.

To open the configuration file you can run tuifeed -c, this will open the
configuration file in your favourite editor.
Edit the generated ~/.config/tuifeed/config.toml so it contains at least one
valid url.
