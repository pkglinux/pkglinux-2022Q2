This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out
there, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding. As compared to
bindings-sqlite3, it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports
marshalling of data values to and from the database. In particular, it
supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.
