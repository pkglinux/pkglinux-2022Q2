This library is a mid-level Haskell binding to the SQLite database.

Sqlite-simple provides a convenient API to sqlite that does some level of
automatic data conversion between the database and Haskell types. The API
has been modeled directly after postgresql-simple which in turn borrows
from mysql-simple.
