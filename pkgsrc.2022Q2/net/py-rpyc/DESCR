RPyC (pronounced like are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent
library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering and
distributed-computing.

RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that employs python's dynamic
nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers,
so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.
