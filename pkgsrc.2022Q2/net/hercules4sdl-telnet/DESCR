Simple RFC-compliant TELNET implementation

libtelnet is a library for handling the TELNET protocol. It includes routines
for parsing incoming data from a remote peer as well as formatting data to be
sent to the remote peer.

libtelnet uses a callback-oriented API, allowing application-specific handling
of various events. The callback system is also used for buffering outgoing
protocol data, allowing the application to maintain control of the actual
socket connection.

Features supported include the full TELNET protocol, Q-method option
negotiation, and NEW-ENVIRON.

This version is the one used by the SoftDevLabs version of
Hercules 4.x (Hyperion).
