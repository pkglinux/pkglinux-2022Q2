Unbound is an implementation of a DNS resolver.  It provides a library
similiar to libresolv that can be used for synchronous and asynchronous
DNS lookups.  It also provides a caching-only (recursive) DNS server.

Unbound has full support for IPv6 and DNSSEC validation,
DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS.
