RQRCodeCore

rqrcode_core is a Ruby library for encoding QR Codes.  The simple interface
(with no runtime dependencies) allows you to create QR Code data structures.
It was originally adapted in 2008 from a Javascript library by Kazuhiko
Arase: https://github.com/kazuhikoarase.

Features

* rqrcode_core is a ruby only library. It requires no native libraries. Just
  Ruby!

  a QR code.
