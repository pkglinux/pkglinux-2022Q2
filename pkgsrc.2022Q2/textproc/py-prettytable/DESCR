PrettyTable is a simple Python library designed to make it quick and easy
to represent tabular data in visually appealing ASCII tables.

PrettyTable lets you control many aspects of the table, like the width of
the column padding, the alignment of text within columns, which characters
are used to draw the table border, whether you even want a border, and much
more. You can control which subsets of the columns and rows are printed, and
you can sort the rows by the value of a particular column.
