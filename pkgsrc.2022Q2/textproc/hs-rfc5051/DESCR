This library implements i;unicode-casemap, the simple, non
locale-sensitive unicode collation algorithm described in RFC 5051
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5051.txt). Proper unicode collation
can be done using text-icu, but that is a big dependency that depends
on a large C library, and rfc5051 might be better for some purposes.
