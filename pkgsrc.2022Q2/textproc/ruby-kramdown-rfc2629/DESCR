kramdown is a markdown parser by Thomas Leitner, which has a number of
backends for generating HTML, Latex, and markdown again.

kramdown-rfc2629 is an additional backend to that: It allows the
generation of XML2RFC XML markup (originally known as RFC 2629
compliant markup, now documented in RFC 7749).
