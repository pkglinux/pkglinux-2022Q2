Recursive _search and replace_ CLI application.

Powerful search can be found without problems, eg, grep, ack, ag, ripgrep
or broot.

Tools for replacing recursively in a folder are more difficult to find,
although some exist: fart-it. Typically, people use a combination of searching,
xargs and a replacement tool like sed or rpl.

I use code searching a lot to investigate a large source code base before
attempting a replace. Even with 100k files, search is fast and fairly easy.
Recursively replacing text is much more dangerous, especially if it requires
the combination of several less frequently used tools; it's difficult to
remember a search-xargs-replace combination if not used on a daily basis.
On top of this, the search tool used to filter the set of files and perform a
dry-run, is not per-se using the same search query as the replace tool.
After all, these are different tools. It would be better if a single tool could
be used for every-day searching and replacing.
This is exactly what The Molybdenum Replacer intends to achieve.
