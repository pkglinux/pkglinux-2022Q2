This library provides convenient combinators for working with and building
parsing combinator libraries.

Given a few simple instances, e.g. for the class
Text.Parser.Combinators.Parsing in Text.Parser.Combinators.Parsing you get
access to a large number of canned definitions. Instances exist for the
parsers provided by parsec, attoparsec and base's Text.Read.
