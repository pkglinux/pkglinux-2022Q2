age is a simple, modern and secure file encryption tool, format,
and Go library.

It features small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style
composability

The format specification is at age-encryption.org/v1. age was
designed by @Benjojo12 and @FiloSottile.

An alternative interoperable Rust implementation is available at
github.com/str4d/rage.
