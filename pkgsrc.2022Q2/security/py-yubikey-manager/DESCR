Use the YubiKey Manager to configure FIDO2, OTP and PIV functionality
on your YubiKey on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.  The
tool works with any currently supported YubiKey.  You can also use the
tool to check the type and firmware of a YubiKey.  In addition, you can
use the extended settings to specify other features, such as to
configure 3-second long touch.
