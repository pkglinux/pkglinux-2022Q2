QuickJS is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It supports the
ES2020 specification including modules, asynchronous generators and
proxies.

It optionally supports mathematical extensions such as big integers
(BigInt), big floating point numbers (BigFloat) and operator
overloading.

Main Features:
 * Small and easily embeddable: just a few C files, no external
   dependency, 190 KiB of x86 code for a simple hello world program.
 * Fast interpreter with very low startup time: runs the 56000
   tests of the ECMAScript Test Suite in about 100 seconds on a
   single core of a desktop PC. The complete life cycle of a runtime
   instance completes in less than 300 microseconds.
 * Almost complete ES2020 support including modules, asynchronous
   generators and full Annex B support (legacy web compatibility).
 * Passes 100% of the ECMAScript Test Suite.
 * Can compile Javascript sources to executables with no external dependency.
 * Garbage collection using reference counting (to reduce memory
   usage and have deterministic behavior) with cycle removal.
 * Mathematical extensions: BigInt, BigFloat, operator overloading,
   bigint mode, math mode.
 * Command line interpreter with contextual colorization implemented
   in Javascript.
 * Small built-in standard library with C library wrappers.
