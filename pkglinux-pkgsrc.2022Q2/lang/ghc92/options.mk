# GHC has a native implementation of codegen (NCG) for some platforms. On
# those platforms LLVM is optional. It's a requirement anywhere else. See
# compiler/GHC/Driver/Backend.hs
#
# The LLVM backend tends to produce slightly faster code than what NCG
# produces, but it is much slower than NCG. It is therefore not the default
# backend on platforms where NCG is available. On platforms where NCG is
# available, LLVM should be disabled by default because it's a huge
# dependency that takes hours to compile.
#
# Note that bootkits also require LLVM/Clang on platforms lacking NCG. This
# can cause a transitional problem when a new compiler arrives with NCG for
# a platform which used to lack one. In this case we have to either (1)
# build a new bootkit for the platform with LLVM backend disabled, or (2)
# reuse the old bootkit by putting llvm/clang in BUILD_DEPENDS (regardless
# of user choice) and arrange parameters so that they are used only by the
# stage-0 compiler. We don't have an infrastructure for (2), as it's not
# worth the additional complexity, so (1) is the only option atm.
