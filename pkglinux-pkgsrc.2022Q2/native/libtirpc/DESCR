LIBTIRPC 0.1 FROM SUN'S TIRPCSRC 2.3 29 Aug 1994

This package contains SunLib's implementation of transport-independent
RPC (TI-RPC) documentation.  This library forms a piece of the base of Open Network

TI-RPC is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V
Transport Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface
(XTI).  TI-RPC is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported
by almost 70 vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code
(RPCSRC 4.0) remains available from several internet sites.

This release was a native source release, compatible for
building on Solaris 2.3. It had been ported from FreeBSD 5.2.1 to GNU/Linux 
in 2004.

Applications linked with this release's librpc must link with the United
States domestic version of libcrypt in order to resolve the cbc_crypt() and
ecb_crypt() functions.  These routines are used with Secure RPC however all
RPC programs that link with this release's librpc will need to link with the
