OpenRC README
=============

OpenRC is a dependency-based init system that works with the
system-provided init program, normally `/sbin/init`.

## building and installing

OpenRC uses the  [meson](http://mesonbuild.com) build system, so use the
usual methods for this build system to build and install.

## Notes

We don't support building a static OpenRC with PAM.

`PKG_PREFIX` should be set to where packages install to by default.

`LOCAL_PREFIX` should be set to where user maintained packages are.
Only set `LOCAL_PREFIX` if different from `PKG_PREFIX`.
