dracut (the tool) is used to create an initramfs image by copying tools
and files from an installed system and combining it with the
dracut framework, usually found in /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d.

Unlike other implementations, dracut hard-codes as little
as possible into the initramfs. The initramfs has
(basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
