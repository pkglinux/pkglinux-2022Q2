BSD style boot scripts for Linux systems.
A fast, robust and simple way to boot.

Less modular and simpler setup than sysv init

Failed boot processes are visible on the console from the error message instead of a fail state on the boot step.

A lot simpler compared to systemd

Systemd offers lots of features besides a boot manager,
for example it has a service manager and logging capabilities built.

The traditional Unix way of partitioning functionality into small semi-independent parts each doing a single job.
leaving the other tasks to the better suited programs which are especially build for this like the syslog daemon to log kernel messages or acpid to handle hibernate.

Also avoids function creep and dependency on tools like D-Bus, PAM or PolicyKit.
