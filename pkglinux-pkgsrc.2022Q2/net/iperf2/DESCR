Iperf is a tool for measuring TCP and UDP bandwidth performance.
It reports bandwidth, delay jitter, datagram loss. It also supports
IPv6 and IP Multicast.

This version is a continuation fork of an older continuation fork of
the original code.  The original code and the first continuation fork
are no longer maintained.   See also net/iperf3.
