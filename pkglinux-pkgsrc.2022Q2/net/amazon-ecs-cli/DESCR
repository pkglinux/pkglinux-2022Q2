The Amazon ECS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line tool for
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) that provides high-level
commands to simplify creating, updating, and monitoring clusters and
tasks from a local development environment. The Amazon ECS CLI supports
Docker Compose, a popular open-source tool for defining and running
multi-container applications. Use the CLI as part of your everyday
development and testing cycle as an alternative to the AWS Management
Console or the AWS CLI.
