pynng provides a nice interface on top of the full power of nng. nng, and
therefore pynng, make it easy to communicate between processes on a single
computer or computers across a network. This library is compatible with Python
3.5 or newer. nng is the rewriting of Nanomsg, which is the spiritual successor
to ZeroMQ.
