The main objective of this is to develop an easy to use and
customizable web interface for Collectd (Resource monitoring
software). Two days of research where enough to realize that collectd
didn't have a real frontend and the one bundled with the backend
was really made for testing purposes, so much of the usability and
strength of statistics was left aside.
