A better way to navigate directories.
-Get an overview of a directory, even a big one
-Find a directory then cd to it
-Never lose track of file hierarchy while you search
-Manipulate your files
-Manage files with panels
-Preview files
-Apply a standard or personal shortcut to a file
-Replace ls (and its clones)
-Sort, see what takes space
-check git statuses
