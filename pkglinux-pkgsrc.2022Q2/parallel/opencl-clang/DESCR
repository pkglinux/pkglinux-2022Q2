OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is an open, royalty-free standard for
cross-platform, parallel programming of diverse accelerators found in
supercomputers, cloud servers, personal computers, mobile devices and
embedded platforms.

opencl-clang is a thin wrapper library around clang. The library has a
OpenCL-oriented API and is capable to compile OpenCL C kernels to SPIR-V
modules for consumption by e.g. GPU drivers.
