The package starts from the basic facilities of the color
package, and provides easy driver-independent access to several
kinds of color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary
colors. It allows a user to select a document-wide target color
model and offers complete tools for conversion between eight
color models. Additionally, there is a command for alternating
row colors plus repeated non-aligned material (like horizontal
lines) in tables. Colors can be mixed like
\color{red!30!green!40!blue}.
