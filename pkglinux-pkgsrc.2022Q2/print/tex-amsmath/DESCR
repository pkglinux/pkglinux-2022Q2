The package provides the principal packages in the AMS-LaTeX
distribution. It adapts for use in LaTeX most of the
mathematical features found in AMS-TeX; it is highly
recommended as an adjunct to serious mathematical typesetting
in LaTeX. When amsmath is loaded, AMS-LaTeX packages amsbsy
(for bold symbols), amsopn (for operator names) and amstext
(for text embedded in mathematics) are also loaded. amsmath is
part of the LaTeX required distribution; however, several
contributed packages add still further to its appeal; examples
are empheq, which provides functions for decorating and
highlighting mathematics, and ntheorem, for specifying theorem
(and similar) definitions.
