This package manages culturally-determined typographical (and
other) rules for a wide range of languages. A document may
select a single language to be supported, or it may select
several, in which case the document may switch from one
language to another in a variety of ways. Babel uses
contributed configuration files that provide the detail of what
has to be done for each language. Included is also a set of ini
files for about 250 languages. Many language styles work with
pdfLaTeX, as well as with XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, out of the box.
A few even work with plain formats.
