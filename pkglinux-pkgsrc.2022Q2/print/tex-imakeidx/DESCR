The package enables the user to produce and typeset one or more
indexes simultaneously with a document. The package is known to
work in LaTeX documents processed with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and
LuaLaTeX. If makeindex is used for processing the index
entries, no particular setting up is needed when TeX Live is
used. Using xindy or other programs it is necessary to enable
shell escape; shell escape is also needed if splitindex is
used.
