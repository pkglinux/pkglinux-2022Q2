The beamer LaTeX class can be used for producing slides. The
class works in both PostScript and direct PDF output modes,
using the pgf graphics system for visual effects. Content is
created in the frame environment, and each frame can be made up
of a number of slides using a simple notation for specifying
material to appear on each slide within a frame. Short versions
of title, authors, institute can also be specified as optional
parameters. Whole frame graphics are supported by plain frames.
The class supports figure and table environments, transparency
effects, varying slide transitions and animations. Beamer also
provides compatibility with other packages like prosper. The
package now incorporates the functionality of the former
translator package, which is used for customising the package
for use in other language environments. Beamer depends on the
following other packages: atbegshi, etoolbox, hyperref, ifpdf,
pgf, and translator.
