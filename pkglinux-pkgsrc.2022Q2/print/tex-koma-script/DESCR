The KOMA-Script bundle provides replacements for the article,
report, and book classes with emphasis on typography and
versatility. There is also a letter class. The bundle also
offers: a package for calculating type areas in the way laid
down by the typographer Jan Tschichold, packages for easily
changing and defining page styles, a package scrdate for
getting not only the current date but also the name of the day,
and a package scrtime for getting the current time. All these
packages may be used not only with KOMA-Script classes but also
with the standard classes. Since every package has its own
version number, the version number quoted only refers to the
version of scrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2 and typearea
(which are the main parts of the bundle).
