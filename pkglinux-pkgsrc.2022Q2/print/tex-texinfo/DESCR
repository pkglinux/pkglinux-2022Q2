Texinfo is the preferred format for documentation in the GNU
project; the format may be used to produce online or printed
output from a single source. The Texinfo macros may be used to
produce printable output using TeX; other programs in the
distribution offer online interactive use (with hypertext
linkages in some cases). The latest release of the texinfo.tex
macros and texi2dvi script may be found in the texinfo-latest
package, which are usually newer than the last full release.
