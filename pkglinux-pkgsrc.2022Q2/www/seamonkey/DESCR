The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey Internet
Application Suite.

- The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet Application
Suite uses the same rendering engine and application platform as Mozilla
Firefox, with popular features like tabbed browsing, feed detection, popup
blocking, smart location bar, find as you type and a lot of other functionality
for a smooth web experience.

- SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with Thunderbird
and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and mail views, web feeds
reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts, S/MIME, address books with
LDAP support and is ready for both private and corporate use.

- Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the ChatZilla
IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM Inspector.
