Arctic Fox aims to be a desktop oriented web browser. It started as a forked
and rebranded Pale Moon 27.9.4 and retains its classic interface. Many fixes
and enhancements have been imported from Firefox and TenFourFox.

The goal here is to implement specific security updates and bug fixes to
keep this browser as up to date as possible for aging systems.
