gtk3-nocsd is a small module used to disable the client side window
decorations (CSDs) in GTK+ 3, which are used by many GNOME
applications.

A shared library is included which can be loaded with LD_PRELOAD to
override several Gdk and glib/gobject APIs used by GTK+ 3 to set up
CSDs.

A wrapper script is also included, which can be used as follows:

	gtk3-nocsd gedit
