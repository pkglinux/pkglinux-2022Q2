xcb: remove multi-connection code path

This code was introduced in 2011 as an experimental feature
and have been untested/unmaintained ever since. It's time to
remove it for the following reasons:

- It has never been documented in QGuiApplication under
  "Supported Command Line Options". The intended command
  line was: ./app -platform xcb:address:display

- I am not aware of other toolkits that would provide this
  functionality - connecting to several X displays simultaneously.

- XCB plugin respects the "-display" command line and DISPLAY
  envvar which should be sufficient. So the "workaround" to get
  your window on 2 X displays is:

    ./app -display :0
    ./app -display :1

- There are no JIRA bugs where users would complain that this
  feature does not work. AFAICT it has not worked for years.
  Almost all functions care only about the "default" connection,
  and don't attempt to support multi-connection.

- This will stop confusing people who want to contribute to
  the XCB plugin.

[ChangeLog][Platform Specific Changes][X11] Connecting to multiple
X servers simultaneously within the same application is no longer
supported.
