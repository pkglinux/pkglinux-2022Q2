glyphs (icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs
from popular 'iconic fonts' such as Font Awesome, Devicons,
Octicons, and others.

Source Code Pro is a set of OpenType fonts that have been designed
to work well in user interface (UI) environments.  SauceCodePro is
the nerd-fonts variant, which needs to have a different name because
of the OFL license.
