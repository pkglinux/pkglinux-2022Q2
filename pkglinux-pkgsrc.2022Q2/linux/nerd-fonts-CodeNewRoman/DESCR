Nerd Fonts patches developer targeted fonts with a high number of
glyphs (icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs
from popular 'iconic fonts' such as Font Awesome, Devicons,
Octicons, and others.

Code New Roman is derived from Code New Roman, a monospaced font.
Code New Roman is based on Mac OS Western New Roman, MONACO,
Windows Consolas/Lusida Consolas, ABeeZee and Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.
This font display allowed a design with proportions closer to normal text
than traditional monospaced fonts like Courier. This allows for more
comfortably reading of extended text on screen. OpenType features include
hanging or lining numerals; slashed, dotted and normal zeros; and alternative
shapes for a number of lowercase letters. The look of text can be tuned to
personal taste by varying the number of bars and waves.
