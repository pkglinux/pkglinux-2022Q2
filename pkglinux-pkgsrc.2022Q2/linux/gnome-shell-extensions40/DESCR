# GNOME Shell Extensions

GNOME Shell Extensions is a collection of extensions providing additional
and optional functionality to GNOME Shell.

Since GNOME Shell is not API stable, extensions work only against a very
specific version of the shell, usually the same as this package (see
"configure --version"). The extensions in this package are supported by GNOME
and will be updated to reflect future API changes in GNOME Shell.

The GNOME wiki has more information about [GNOME Shell Extensions][project-page],
as well as some general information about [GNOME Shell][shell-page].

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME [bug tracking system][bug-tracker].
