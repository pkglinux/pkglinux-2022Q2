PowerTOP is a Linux* tool used to diagnose issues with power consumption and
power management. In addition to being a diagnostic tool, PowerTOP also has an
interactive mode you can use to experiment with various power management
settings, for cases where the Linux distribution has not enabled those
settings.


# Build dependencies

PowerTOP is coded in C++. It was written for Linux-based operating systems.
GNU* libc (`glibc`) and Linux `pthreads` are needed for PowerTOP to function
properly. The GNU build system (`autoconf`, `automake`, `make`, `libtool`), as
well as `gettext`, are required to build PowerTOP.

In addition, PowerTOP requires the following:

* kernel version => 2.6.38
* `ncurses-devel` (required)
...
