1. [As discussed in #3107](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/issues/3107), the default branch of this repository is now 'main'. This change should be transparent to repository users, since github rewrites many references to the old 'master' branch to 'main'. However, if you have a checked-out local clone, you may wish to take the following steps as recommended by github:

```sh
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```

2. C++17 (all platforms) and Visual Studio 2019 (Windows) are now required. This change was driven by the external dependency on SPIRV-Tools.
