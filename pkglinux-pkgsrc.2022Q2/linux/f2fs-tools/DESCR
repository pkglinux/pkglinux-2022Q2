NAND flash memory-based storage devices, such as SSD, eMMC, and SD cards, have been equipped on a variety systems ranging from mobile to server systems. Since they are known to have different characteristics from the conventional rotating disks, a file system, an upper layer to the storage device, should adapt to the changes from the sketch in the design level.

F2FS is a file system exploiting NAND flash memory-based storage devices, which is based on Log-structured File System (LFS). The design has been focused on addressing the fundamental issues in LFS, which are snowball effect of wandering tree and high cleaning overhead.

Since a NAND flash memory-based storage device shows different characteristic according to its internal geometry or flash memory management scheme, namely FTL, F2FS and its tools support various parameters not only for configuring on-disk layout, but also for selecting allocation and cleaning algorithms.

F2FS format utilility
---------------------

To use f2fs filesystem, you should format the storage partition
with this utilility. Otherwise, you cannot mount f2fs.

Before compilation
------------------

You should install the following packages.
 - libuuid-devel or uuid-dev
 - pkg-config
 - autoconf
 - libtool
 - libselinux1-dev

Initial compilation
-------------------

Before compilation initially, autoconf/automake tools should be run.
