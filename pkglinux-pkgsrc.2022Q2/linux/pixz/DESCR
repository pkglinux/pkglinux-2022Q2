pixz vs xz
----------

The existing [XZ Utils](http://tukaani.org/xz/) provide great compression in the `.xz` file format,
but they produce just one big block of compressed data. Pixz instead produces a collection of
smaller blocks which makes random access to the original data possible. This is especially useful
for large tarballs.
