Thanks for using gSOAP!

The gSOAP toolkit provides a cross-platform software development toolkit for C
and C++ server and client Web service applications, and simplifies the overall
use of XML in any type of application. The toolkit supports SOAP 1.1/1.2 RPC
encoding and document/literal styles, WSDL 1.1, MTOM/MIME/DIME attachments
(streaming), SOAP-over-UDP, request-response and one-way messaging. The toolkit
also supports WS-Addressing and WS-Security, with several other WS-* available
or under development. See the official open-source gSOAP website
http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net for project status and latest news.

* The gSOAP 'soapcpp2' compiler and code generator and 'stdsoap2' runtime
  engine are stable since version release 2.1.3.

* The gSOAP 'wsdl2h' WSDL/schema parser and code generator is stable since
  wsdl2h version release 1.1.0. The 'wsdl2h' tool fully supports WSDL 1.1,
  XML schemas, WS-Policy, and other WS-* protocols (details in the fact sheet).
