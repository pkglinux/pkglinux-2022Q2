Introduction

XML is slow to parse and strings inside the document cannot be memory mapped as they do not have a trailing NUL char. The libxmlb library takes XML source, and converts it to a structured binary representation with a deduplicated string table -- where the strings have the NULs included.

This allows an application to mmap the binary XML file, do an XPath query and return some strings without actually parsing the entire document. This is all done using (almost) zero allocations and no actual copying of the binary data.

As each node in the binary XML file encodes the 'next' node at the same level it makes skipping whole subtrees trivial. A 10Mb binary XML file can be loaded from disk and queried in less than a few milliseconds.

The binary XML is not supposed to be small. It's usually about half the size of the text XML data where a lot of the tag content is duplicated, but can actually be larger than the original XML file. This isn't important; the fast query speed and the ability to mmap strings without copies more than makes up for the larger on-disk size. If you want to compress your XML, this library probably isn't for you -- just use gzip -- it gives you an almost a perfect compression ratio for data like this.
