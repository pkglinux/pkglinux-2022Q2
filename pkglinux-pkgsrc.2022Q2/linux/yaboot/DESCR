Please read the "COPYING" file for licence informations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yaboot is an OpenFirmware bootloader for Open Firmware based
machines. It is known to work on "NewWorld" class powermacs (iMac and
all machines released after it), RS/6000, and possibly other OF based
CHRP machines. "OldWorld" PowerMacs (with the built-in MacOS ROM)
are not supported.

This README serves as a quick-start introduction to yaboot and its
installation utilities. For a more complete usage and installation
guide, see yaboot-howto.html/index.en.html in the same folder where
this README is located, or else inside the doc folder in this
directory. For documentation about all the options available, see the
man pages (bootstrap, yaboot, yaboot.conf, ybin, mkofboot, ofpath,
yabootconfig).
