This package contains rpcsvc proto.x files from glibc, which are
missing in libtirpc. Additional it contains rpcgen, which is needed
to create header files and sources from protocol files.
This package is only needed, if glibc is installed without the
deprecated sunrpc functionality and libtirpc should replace it.
