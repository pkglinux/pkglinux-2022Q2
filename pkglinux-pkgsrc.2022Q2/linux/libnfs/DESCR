This is the final release of the old API.

LIBNFS is a client library for accessing NFS shares over a network.

LIBNFS offers three different APIs, for different use :

This API is described in include/libnfs-raw.h
it offers a fully async interface to raw XDR encoded blobs.
This API provides very flexible and precise control of the RPC issued.

examples/nfsclient-raw.c provides examples on how to use the raw API

2, NFS ASYNC : A fully asynchronous library for high level vfs functions
This API is described by the *_async() functions in include/libnfs.h.
This API provides a fully async access to posix vfs like functions such as
stat(), read(), ...

examples/nfsclient-async.c provides examples on how to use this API
