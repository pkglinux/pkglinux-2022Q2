DESCRIPTION

tardiff and tarpatch are tools to compute the differences between binary files,
and to reconstruct files from a base file and a list of differences. They work
with a block size of 512 bytes, which makes them suitable for computing
differences of tar files, which is also their intended use.


DEPENDENCIES

  - zlib 1.2.3 (or compatible)
  - OpenSSL 0.9.8 (or compatible)


EXAMPLE

Suppose I back-up my files in a tar archive every week. After three weeks, I
have three files:

    files-1.tar
...
