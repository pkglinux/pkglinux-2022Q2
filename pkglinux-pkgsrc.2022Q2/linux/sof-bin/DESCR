## Notice on Platform Coverage

WARNING: starting with v2.2, older Intel products are not supported by
the main SOF development branch anymore. To avoid duplication and
confusion in this sof-bin git repository, older product generations are
now intentionally MISSING from sof-bin subdirectories v2.x/sof-v2.2/ and
above.

For a complete release that includes all Intel products including older
ones you MUST use official release tarballs found here:

  https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin/releases

Installing directly from the sof-bin git repo should still work but it
will only install a subset.

Tarballs are now a combination of several sof-bin subdirectories
generated by a new release script. They include a new manifest.txt
describing that combination. For more details see Github issue #90.
