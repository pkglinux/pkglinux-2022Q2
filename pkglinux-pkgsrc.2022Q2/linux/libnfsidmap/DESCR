Library to help mapping id's, mainly for NFSv4.

When NFSv4 is using AUTH_GSS (which currently only supports Kerberos v5), the
NFSv4 server mapping functions MUST use secure communications.

We provide several mapping functions, configured using /etc/idmapd.conf

As of the 0.21 version of this library, mapping methods are separate
dynamically-loaded libaries.  This allows the separation of any
LDAP requirements from the main libnfsidmap library.  The main library
now basically loads and calls the functions in the method-specific
libaries.  The method libraries are expected to be named
"libnfsidmap_<method>.so", for example, "libnfsidmap_nsswitch.so".

Several methods may be specified in the /etc/idmapd.conf configuration
file.  Each method is called until a mapping is found.

The following translation methods are delivered in the default distribution:

nsswitch
...
