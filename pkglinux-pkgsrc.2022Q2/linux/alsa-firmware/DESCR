GENERAL
=======

This package contains the firmware binaries for each loader program
included in alsa-tools package.  The firmware data can be used by each
ALSA firmware loader program like vxloader, or passed through the
hotplug firmware-loading mechanism.


HOTPLUG FIRMWARE LOADER SUPPORT
===============================

The recent ALSA driver supports the hotplug firmware loader.
As default, the package will install firmware data to the places for
both the old ALSA fw loader and the hotplug fw loader.  To disable
the installation of old ALSA fw loader data (if both ALSA and hotplug
fw loaders are available), pass --disable-loader to configure.
Similarly, to disable the hotplug fw loader data, pass
--disable-hotplug option.
