ModemManager.
ModemManager provides a unified high level API for communicating with mobile
broadband modems, regardless of the protocol used to communicate with the
actual device (Generic AT, vendor-specific AT, QCDM, QMI, MBIM...).

Using.
ModemManager is a system daemon and is not meant to be used directly from
the command line. However, since it provides a DBus API, it is possible to use
'dbus-send' commands or the new 'mmcli' command line interface to control it
from the terminal. The devices are queried from udev and automatically updated
based on hardware events, although a manual re-scan can also be requested to
look for RS232 modems.

Implementation.
ModemManager is a DBus system bus activated service (meaning it's started
automatically when a request arrives). It is written in C, using glib and gio.
Several GInterfaces specify different features that the modems support,
including the generic MMIfaceModem3gpp and MMIfaceModemCdma which provide basic
operations for 3GPP (GSM, UMTS, LTE) or CDMA (CDMA1x, EV-DO) modems. If a given
feature is not available in the modem, the specific interface will not be
