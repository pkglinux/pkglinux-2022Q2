This package contains Linux man pages for sections 1 through 8.  Some
more information is given in the 'man-pages-x.y.Announce' file.

Installing and uninstalling
===========================
"make install" will copy these man pages to /usr/share/man/man[1-8].

To install to a path different from /usr, use
"make install prefix=/install/path".

"make remove" or "make uninstall" will remove any man page in this
distribution from its destination.  Use with caution, and remember to
use "prefix" if desired, as with the "install" target.

"make" or "make all" will perform "make uninstall" followed by "make
install".

Man page overlap and duplication
================================
Note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages also distributed
