Discontinued: Intel releases signed firmware files with
the topology binary files on github (search through branches):

https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin

------

This directory contains SOF firmware files compiled in docker
and combined with the binary signed firmware files from Intel.

Source and binary files are downloaded from:

https://github.com/thesofproject/sof
https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/blob/master/LICENCE
https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/releases

Latest:

- added snd-cml.ri and snd-cfl.ri symlinks to snd-cnl.ri
- fixed the sof/gcc tree (wrong symlinks instead binaries)
