LIBATASMART ATA S.M.A.R.T. Reading and Parsing Library

NOTES:
        As the name suggests libatasmart only does ATA S.M.A.R.T.,
        there is no support for SCSI harddisks. SCSI S.M.A.R.T. is a
        very different system, support for it should be implemented in
        a separate library "libscsismart" if there should ever be
        demand for it.

        This library is supposed to be lean and small and thus
        supports only a subset of the S.M.A.R.T. functionality.
        However, I claim that it implements the relevant part of it.
        If you need full control over all S.M.A.R.T. functionality of
        your hardware please refer to Buce Allen's smartmontools.
