ANSI C General Decimal Arithmetic Library

The decNumber library implements the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification
in ANSI C. This specification defines a decimal arithmetic which meets the
requirements of commercial, financial, and human-oriented applications. It also
matches the decimal arithmetic in the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating Point
Arithmetic.

The library fully implements the specification, and hence supports integer,
fixed-point, and floating-point decimal numbers directly, including infinite,
NaN (Not a Number), and subnormal values. Both arbitrary-precision and
fixed-size representations are supported.

Refer to the package's PDF file for more information.

This version is the one used by the SoftDevLabs version of
Hercules 4.x (Hyperion).
