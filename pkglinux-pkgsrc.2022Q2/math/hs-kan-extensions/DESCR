This package provides tools for working with various Kan extensions and Kan
lifts in Haskell.

Among the interesting bits included are:
* Right and left Kan extensions (Ran and Lan)
* Right and left Kan lifts (Rift and Lift)
* Multiple forms of the Yoneda lemma (Yoneda)
* The Codensity monad, which can be used to improve the asymptotic
  complexity of code over free monads (Codensity, Density)
* A "comonad to monad-transformer transformer" that is a special case of a
  right Kan lift. (CoT, Co)
