The IETF uses a specific format for the standards and other documents
it publishes as RFCs, and for the draft documents which are produced
when developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of
different tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs
according to the existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of
them.  It takes as input an xml file which contains the text and
meta-information about author names etc., and transforms it into
suitably formatted output.  The input xml file should follow the
grammars in RFC 7749 (for v2 documents) or RFC 7991 (for v3 documents).
Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and changes will
eventually be captured in the bis draft for 7991.
