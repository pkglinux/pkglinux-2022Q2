Basic types for representing XML.

The idea is to have a full set of appropriate types, which various XML
libraries can share. Instead of having equivalent-but-incompatible
types for every binding, parser, or client, they all share the same
types can can thus interoperate easily.

This library contains complete types for most parts of an XML
document, including the prologue, node tree, and doctype. Some basic
combinators are included for common tasks, including traversing the
node tree and filtering children.
