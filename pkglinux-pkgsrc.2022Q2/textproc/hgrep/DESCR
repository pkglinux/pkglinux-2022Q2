hgrep is a grep tool to search files with given pattern and print the matched
code snippets with human-friendly syntax highlighting.
In short, it's a fusion of bat and grep or other alternatives like ripgrep.

This is similar to -C option of grep command, but hgrep focuses on human
readable outputs. hgrep is useful to survey the matches with contexts around
them.
When some matches are near enough, hgrep prints the lines within one code
snippet. Unlike grep -C, hgrep adopts some heuristics around blank lines to
determine efficient number of context lines.

As an optional feature, hgrep has builtin grep implementation thanks to ripgrep
as library. It's a subset of rg command. And it's faster when there are so many
matches since everything is done in the same process.
