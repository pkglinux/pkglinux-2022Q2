jless is a command-line JSON viewer.
Use it as a replacement for whatever combination of less, jq, cat and your
editor you currently use for viewing JSON files.
It is written in Rust and can be installed as a single standalone binary.

Features
   -Clean syntax highlighted display of JSON data, omitting quotes around
    object keys, closing object and array delimiters, and trailing commas.
   -Expand and collapse objects and arrays so you can see both the high- and
    low-level structure of the data.
   -A wealth of vim-inspired movement commands for efficiently moving around
    and viewing data.
   -Full regex-based search for finding exactly the data you're looking for.
