ftcsv is a fast csv library written in pure Lua.

It features two parsing modes, one for CSVs that can easily be loaded into
memory (up to a few hundred MBs depending on the system), and another for
loading files using an iterator - useful for manipulating large files or
processing during load.

It correctly handles most csv (and csv-like) files found in the wild, from
varying line endings (Windows, Linux, and OS9), UTF-8 BOM support, and odd
delimiters.

There are also various options that can tweak how a file is loaded, only
grabbing a few fields, renaming fields, and parsing header-less files!
