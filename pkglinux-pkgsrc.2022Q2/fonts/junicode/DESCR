Junicode (short for Junius-Unicode) is a Unicode font for medievalists.

Junicode currently contains 3002 characters in the regular style. These
Unicode ranges are either complete in the regular style or they contain
substantial numbers of glyphs (especially those of interest to
medievalists). 

All faces contain numerous OpenType features, most of which are
accessible in MS Word and other modern word processing and desktop
publishing programs. These are mostly of interest to medievalists, but
several also support typographical features common in 17th- and
18th-century books. See the documentation, Junicode.pdf, for full
details.

This is the "legacy" version of Junicode; for Junicode version 2, which
is still in development, see https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font.
