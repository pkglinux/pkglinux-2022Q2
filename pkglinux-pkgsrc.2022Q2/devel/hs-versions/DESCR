A library for parsing and comparing software version numbers. We like to
give version numbers to our software in a myriad of ways. Some ways follow
strict guidelines for incrementing and comparison. Some follow conventional
wisdom and are generally self-consistent. Some are just plain asinine. This
library provides a means of parsing and comparing any style of versioning,
be it a nice Semantic Version like this:

  1.2.3-r1+git123

...or a monstrosity like this:

  2:10.2+0.0093r3+1-1

Please switch to Semantic Versioning if you aren't currently using it. It
provides consistency in version incrementing and has the best constraints
on comparisons.

This library implements version 2.0.0 of the SemVer spec.
