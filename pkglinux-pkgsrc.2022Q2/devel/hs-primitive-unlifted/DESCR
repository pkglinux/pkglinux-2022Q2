Primitive GHC types with unlifted types inside. There used to be a module
named Data.Primitive.UnliftedArray in the primitive library. However, it
turns out that it is impossible to write such an API safely in versions of
GHC before 8.10.1, thanks to some nasty interactions between unsafe
coercions and the foreign function interface. This package also uses a
somewhat different, and more flexible, approach than that module did.
