Atomically write to a file on POSIX-compliant systems while preserving
permissions.

On most Unix systems, mv is an atomic operation. This makes it simple to
write to a file atomically just by using the mv operation. However, this
will destroy the permissions on the original file. This library does the
following to preserve permissions while atomically writing to a file:

* If an original file exists, take those permissions and apply them to the
  temp file before mving the file into place.

* If the original file does not exist, create a following with default
  permissions (based on the currently-active umask).

This way, when the file is mv'ed into place, the permissions will be the
ones held by the original file.
