pycotap is a simple Python test runner for unittest that outputs
Test Anything Protocol results directly to standard output.

Contrary to other TAP runners for Python, pycotap:

    * prints TAP (and only TAP) to standard output instead of to
    a separate file, allowing you to pipe it directly to TAP pretty
    printers and processors (such as the ones listed on the tape
    page). By piping it to other consumers, you can avoid the need
    to add specific test runners to your test code. Since the TAP
    results are printed as they come in, the consumers can directly
    display results while the tests are run.
    * only contains a TAP reporter, so no parsers, no frameworks,
    no dependencies.
    * is configurable: you can choose how you want the test output
    and test result diagnostics to end up in your TAP output (as
    TAP diagnostics, YAML blocks, or attachments). The defaults
    are optimized for a Jenkins based flow.
