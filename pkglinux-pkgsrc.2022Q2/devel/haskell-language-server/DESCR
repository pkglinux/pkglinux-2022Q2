The haskell-language-server (HLS) project is an implementation of a server
(a "language server") for the Language Server Protocol (LSP). A language
server talks to a client (typically an editor), which can ask the server to
perform various operations, such as reporting errors or providing code
completions. The advantage of this system is that clients and servers can
interoperate more easily so long as they all speak the LSP protocol. In the
case of HLS, that means that it can be used with many different editors,
since editor support for the LSP protocol is now widespread.
