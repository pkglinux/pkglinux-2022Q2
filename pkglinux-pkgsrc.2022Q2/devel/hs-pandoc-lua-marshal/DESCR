This package provides functions to marshal and unmarshal pandoc document
types to and from Lua.

The values of most types are pushed to pandoc as "userdata" objects that
wrap a stable pointer to the Haskell value; these objects come with methods
to access and modify their properties.

Sequences are pushed as normal Lua tables, but are augmented with
convenience functions.
