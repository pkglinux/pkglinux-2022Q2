This package (formerly binary-serialise-cbor) provides pure, efficient
serialization of Haskell values directly into ByteStrings for storage or
transmission purposes. By providing a set of type class instances, you can
also serialise any custom data type you have as well.

The underlying binary format used is the 'Concise Binary Object
Representation', or CBOR, specified in RFC 7049. As a result, serialised
Haskell values have implicit structure outside of the Haskell program
itself, meaning they can be inspected or analyzed without custom tools.
