This package contains a perl module to access mmap.

The Sys::Mmap module uses the POSIX mmap call to map in a file as a
Perl variable. Memory access by mmap may be shared between threads or
forked processes, and may be a disc file that has been mapped into
memory. Sys::Mmap depends on your operating system supporting UNIX or
POSIX.1b mmap, of course.
