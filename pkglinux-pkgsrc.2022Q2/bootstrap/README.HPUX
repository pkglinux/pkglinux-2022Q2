As of 2021-06-18, pkgsrc was known to bootstrap on HP-UX 11.31 ia64
using the HP compiler if "--compiler hp" was specified.
If a GCC toolchain is available, it may be preferrable to use that.

Prerequisite patches (downloadable from HP itrc)
------------------------------------------------
 * The latest HP-UX "quality pack" patch bundle (GOLDQPK)
 * ld(1) cumulative patch (might be included in the above)

Compiler
--------
Prebuilt PA-RISC GCC toolchains suitable for use with pkgsrc can be
downloaded from
ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/misc/tnn/ .

Installation instructions can be found in the file "README.gcc".

Selecting which ABI to use
--------------------------
HP-UX supports the ABIs and object formats listed in the table below.
32-bit is the default, 64-bit can be enabled by setting ABI=64 in mk.conf.
The correct object format to use is autodetected.

Release		Architecture	ABI	Object format
 11i v1/v2	PA-RISC	1.1+	32	SOM
 11i v1/v2	PA-RISC 2.0	64	ELF
 11i v2/v3	IA64		32/64	ELF
